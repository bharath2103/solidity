# Simple Voting Contract

This Solidity contract implements a basic voting system.

## Features:

1. **Party Registration:** Only the contract owner can register parties for the election.
2. **Voter Registration:** The contract owner can register eligible voters.
3. **Voting:** Registered voters can cast a single vote for their chosen party.
4. **Polling Control:** The contract owner can start and stop the polling period.
5. **Results:** When polling stops, the contract can determine and return the winning party's name and the number of votes they received.
