# Simple Voting Contract

This Solidity contract implements a basic voting system. 

## Core Features:

* **Party Registration:**
    * Only the contract owner (the address that deployed the contract) can register parties for the election.
    * Each party has a `name`, a designated `self_address` (presumably a wallet address), and a `vote` count (initialized to 0).
* **Voting:**
    * The contract currently lacks a voting mechanism. You'll need to add a function that allows eligible voters to cast their votes for a specific party.

## Data Structures:

* `Party` struct: Stores information about each participating party.
* `parties` array: Holds all registered `Party` structs.
* `partyindex` mapping: Maps party names (`string`) to their corresponding index (`int`) in the `parties` array. This might be intended for efficient party lookup.
* `n`: An integer seemingly used as a counter for assigning indices to parties in the `partyindex` mapping.

## Potential Improvements:

* **Voting Mechanism:** Implement a function to allow users to vote. Consider:
    * Voter eligibility (e.g., using a list of allowed addresses).
    * Preventing double voting (e.g., storing a mapping of voters to booleans indicating whether they've voted).
    * Security against manipulation (e.g., using commit-reveal schemes or zero-knowledge proofs).
* **Vote Tallying:** Add a function to retrieve the vote count for each party or determine the winner.
* **Event Emission:** Emit events when significant actions occur (e.g., party registration, vote casting) to facilitate off-chain monitoring and data indexing.
* **Error Handling:** Enhance error messages and use `require` statements to enforce constraints (e.g., ensuring a party exists before a vote can be cast).

## Example Usage (After Adding Voting Functionality):

1. **Deploy Contract:** The contract owner deploys the `voting` contract.
2. **Register Parties:** The contract owner registers parties using the `register` function, providing a name and wallet address for each.
3. **Cast Votes:** Eligible voters call a voting function (to be implemented) to cast their votes for their chosen party.
4. **View Results:** Anyone can call a vote tallying function (to be implemented) to see the current vote count for each party or determine the winner.

**Note:** This README assumes the intended functionality based on the provided code. You might need to adjust it further based on your specific requirements and any additional features you implement.
